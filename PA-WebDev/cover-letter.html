                    <strong>Hello! My name is Mackenzie Latham.</strong><br>
                    I am a current student pursuing a bachelor's degree in <em>computer science</em>. 
                    I am passionate about learning whatever is needed to deliver an outstanding product to my future clients. 
                    <hr>
                    My previous work experience involved learning the various processes for assembling electronic devices that monitored the power grid, such as relays and recloser controls. 
                    I have experience with operating heavy machinery and performing preventative maintenance, as well as knowing the industry standards for the quality assembly of <mark id="pcb">printed circuit boards,</mark> <mark id="smt">surface mount components,</mark> and <mark id="wire">wire harnesses.</mark> 
                    I am eager to take on this new challenge and look forward to connecting with you!
